I am Pablo! I am a passionate robotics researcher and engineer pursuing my PhD in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. I am a member of the roBot Intelligence Group [(BIG)](https://cmubig.github.io/) supervised by Dr. Jean Oh. 

I like making things that work in the real world! My research interest is developing frameworks for efficiently leveraging large pretrained models for embodied systems. Recently, I have been exploring how to distill knowledge from conversational agentic frameworks into compact representations that can be used for light-weight inference.

Before my PhD, I received my bachelor's degree in Robotics and Digital Systems Engineering from Tec de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara.
